22. How does EC2 placement groups work and what are their use cases?

Placement groups in AWS are a feature that allows you to influence the way your Amazon EC2 instances are placed within the AWS infrastructure. Placement groups can help optimize network performance, improve fault tolerance, and enable specific deployment scenarios.

Cluster Placement Groups: Cluster placement groups are used for applications that require low-latency and high-bandwidth networking. When you create a cluster placement group, EC2 instances are placed in close proximity to provide low network latency and high network throughput. The instances in a cluster placement group are typically within a single Availability Zone (AZ) or spread across multiple AZs that are closely located. This placement strategy is particularly beneficial for applications that rely on fast inter-instance communication or require high network performance, such as big data processing, high-performance computing (HPC), or distributed file systems


Spread Placement Groups: Spread placement groups are designed for applications that require high availability and fault tolerance. When you create a spread placement group, EC2 instances are placed on separate underlying hardware infrastructure to reduce the risk of simultaneous failures. Spread placement groups ensure that instances are distributed across different racks, enabling better isolation in case of hardware failures. Spread placement groups are particularly useful for critical applications or deployments that require regulatory compliance and need instances to be isolated from each other.


This region, network,these are isolated locations within a region that are designed to be independent from each other in terms of power, cooling, and network connectivity. EC2 instance placement in different AZs follows a process that aims to provide fault tolerance, high availability, and workload distributio


23. What is the difference between instance store-backed and EBS-backed instances?

when you instance stored backup when the machine is shut down the data is  lost since the instance has physical memory attached to it, this is also known as empherical storage


Ephemeral storage directly attached to the host.

Temporary storage that is not preserved when the instance is stopped or terminated.

High I/O performance.

Ideal for stateless applications or applications with data replicated across multiple instances or availability zones.

Cost-effective as no additional storage costs are incurred.


where as EBS elastic block storage , each instance is attached with seperate volume

Root volume and additional EBS volumes attached to the instance.

Persistent storage that remains even when the instance is stopped or terminated.

Flexible storage options, including different volume types, sizes, and performance characteristics.

Snapshots for data backups, replication, and disaster recovery.

Ability to resize, detach, and reattach volumes.

Suitable for applications with persistent data requirements or those that require advanced storage features.
