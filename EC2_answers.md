How does EC2 placement groups work and what are their use cases?

Placement groups in AWS are a feature that allows you to influence the way your Amazon EC2 instances are placed within the AWS infrastructure. Placement groups can help optimize network performance, improve fault tolerance, and enable specific deployment scenarios.

Cluster Placement Groups: Cluster placement groups are used for applications that require low-latency and high-bandwidth networking. When you create a cluster placement group, EC2 instances are placed in close proximity to provide low network latency and high network throughput. The instances in a cluster placement group are typically within a single Availability Zone (AZ) or spread across multiple AZs that are closely located. This placement strategy is particularly beneficial for applications that rely on fast inter-instance communication or require high network performance, such as big data processing, high-performance computing (HPC), or distributed file systems


Spread Placement Groups: Spread placement groups are designed for applications that require high availability and fault tolerance. When you create a spread placement group, EC2 instances are placed on separate underlying hardware infrastructure to reduce the risk of simultaneous failures. Spread placement groups ensure that instances are distributed across different racks, enabling better isolation in case of hardware failures. Spread placement groups are particularly useful for critical applications or deployments that require regulatory compliance and need instances to be isolated from each other.

EC2 instance placement in different AZs follows a process that aims to provide fault tolerance, high availability, and workload distributio
