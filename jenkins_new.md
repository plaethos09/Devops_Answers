    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Code for building the application (e.g., compiling)
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Code for running tests
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {

def instance = Jenkins.getInstance()
def hudsonRealm = new HudsonPrivateSecurityRealm(false)
hudsonRealm.createAccount('admin', 'admin') // Example admin user creation
instance.setSecurityRealm(hudsonRealm)
instance.save()

            }
        }
        // Other stages...
    }
}
```

```

### 11.What is the role of the Jenkinsfile in pipeline configuration?
### Role of the Jenkinsfile in pipeline configuration:
Jenkinsfile is the configuration file defining pipeline steps, residing in the project's version control system. It's written in Groovy.
