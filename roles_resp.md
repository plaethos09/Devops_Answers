   - Establish and maintain identity and access management (IAM) policies for secure resource access.
   - Conduct security audits and assessments, addressing and mitigating potential vulnerabilities.

7. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting solutions using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch.
   - Implement centralized logging using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to facilitate troubleshooting and analysis.
   - Perform proactive monitoring and incident response to ensure system availability and performance.

8. **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:**
   - Collaborate with development, operations, and QA teams to establish effective communication and cross-functional cooperation.
   - Document and share best practices, architectural decisions, and troubleshooting guides within the team.
   - Mentor junior team members and contribute to their skill development.

9. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Analyze application and system performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
   - Implement performance tuning strategies, including optimizing database queries, network configurations, and resource utilization.

10. **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:**
    - Develop and maintain disaster recovery plans and run regular drills to ensure data integrity and service availability during unexpected outages or disasters.
    - Implement automated backup and restoration processes for critical systems and databases.

**Responsibilities:**

1. **Design and Architecture:**
   - Collaborate with software architects to design scalable, resilient, and secure infrastructure solutions.
   - Plan and implement multi-environment strategies (development, staging, production) to support SDLC stages.

2. **Code Versioning and Collaboration:**
   - Utilize Git for version control, enforcing branching strategies and code review processes.
   - Facilitate collaboration among developers and maintain code repositories.

3. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Stay up-to-date with industry trends and emerging technologies to drive continuous improvement in DevOps practices.
   - Evaluate and introduce new tools and methodologies to optimize workflows.

4. **Problem Solving and Troubleshooting:**
   - Diagnose complex issues across the application and infrastructure stack, employing a systematic approach to root cause analysis.
   - Develop and implement solutions to resolve incidents and prevent recurrence.

5. **Communication and Documentation:**
   - Clearly communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, facilitating effective decision-making.
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation for architecture, configurations, and procedures.

6. **Vendor Management:**
   - Engage with technology vendors to evaluate and adopt tools and services that align with organizational goals.
   - Manage relationships with third-party service providers for cloud services and tools.

7. **Adaptation and Scaling:**
   - Scale infrastructure and applications to accommodate growing workloads and changing business requirements.
   - Monitor performance metrics and adjust configurations as needed to optimize resource utilization.

8. **Compliance and Governance:**
   - Ensure compliance with industry regulations and security standards relevant to the financial and FMCG sectors.
   - Participate in audits and ensure documentation meets regulatory requirements.

9. **Training and Mentoring:**
   - Provide training sessions and mentorship to junior team members to enhance their technical skills and knowledge.

10. **Emergency Response:**
    - Participate in on-call rotations to respond to critical incidents and ensure the stability of systems during emergencies.
