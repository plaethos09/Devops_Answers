### 1. Difference between AWS CloudFormation and Terraform:
   - Terraform is a multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning tool, while AWS CloudFormation is specific to AWS and provides a native way to define and deploy infrastructure.

### 2. How Terraform handles AWS resource provisioning and management:
   - Terraform uses declarative configuration files to define and manage AWS resources, creating an execution plan to apply changes efficiently.

### 3. Concept of "Infrastructure as Code" and its significance in AWS and Terraform:
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts, providing version control and automation benefits, crucial for AWS and Terraform for consistent and scalable deployments.

### 4. Defining AWS resources in Terraform:
   - Resources are defined using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) syntax in Terraform configuration files, specifying the desired state of AWS infrastructure.

### 5. Purpose of AWS provider in Terraform and its configuration:
   - The AWS provider in Terraform serves as the interface to AWS services, and it is configured with AWS access credentials and region information.

### 6. Terraform authentication and authorization for AWS API calls:
   - Terraform uses AWS access keys or IAM roles for authentication, and authorization is managed through IAM policies associated with these credentials.

### 7. Difference between AWS access keys and IAM roles in Terraform authentication:
   - Access keys are static credentials, while IAM roles provide temporary security credentials with defined permissions, enhancing security in Terraform.

## 8. Significance of Terraform state in managing AWS resources:
   - Terraform state stores the current state of infrastructure and is crucial for tracking changes, enabling Terraform to plan and apply updates accurately.

### 9. Managing and sharing Terraform state in a team:
   - Terraform state can be stored remotely (e.g., in AWS S3) and locked to prevent concurrent modifications, facilitating collaboration and version control in a team.

### 10. Handling AWS resource dependencies and provisioning order in Terraform:
    - Terraform automatically manages dependencies based on resource definitions, ensuring correct provisioning order during execution.
