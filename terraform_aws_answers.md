### 1. Difference between AWS CloudFormation and Terraform:
   - Terraform is a multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning tool, while AWS CloudFormation is specific to AWS and provides a native way to define and deploy infrastructure.

### 2. How Terraform handles AWS resource provisioning and management:
   - Terraform uses declarative configuration files to define and manage AWS resources, creating an execution plan to apply changes efficiently.

### 3. Concept of "Infrastructure as Code" and its significance in AWS and Terraform:
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts, providing version control and automation benefits, crucial for AWS and Terraform for consistent and scalable deployments.

### 4. Defining AWS resources in Terraform:
   - Resources are defined using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) syntax in Terraform configuration files, specifying the desired state of AWS infrastructure.
```
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI, replace with your desired AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "MyEC2Instance"
  }
}
```
### 5. Purpose of AWS provider in Terraform and its configuration:
   - The AWS provider in Terraform serves as the interface to AWS services, and it is configured with AWS access credentials and region information.

### 6. Terraform authentication and authorization for AWS API calls:
   - Terraform uses AWS access keys or IAM roles for authentication, and authorization is managed through IAM policies associated with these credentials.

In Terraform, authentication and authorization for AWS API calls are typically handled using AWS access keys. Here's an example of how you can configure Terraform to authenticate with AWS using access keys:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region

  access_key = "your-access-key"
  secret_key = "your-secret-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-access-key"` and `"your-secret-key"` with your AWS access key and secret key, respectively.

It's important to note that storing access keys directly in Terraform configuration files is not recommended for production use due to security concerns. A better practice is to use AWS IAM roles and IAM instance profiles for EC2 instances to manage access permissions.

To enhance security, consider using environment variables or another method to provide the AWS credentials, such as using the AWS CLI to configure credentials:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}
```

Then, configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

This command will prompt you to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format. Terraform will then use the configured credentials from the AWS CLI.

Remember to follow security best practices, such as using IAM roles with the principle of least privilege, to ensure secure authentication and authorization for AWS API calls in your infrastructure.

### 7. Difference between AWS access keys and IAM roles in Terraform authentication:
   - Access keys are static credentials, while IAM roles provide temporary security credentials with defined permissions, enhancing security in Terraform.

## 8. Significance of Terraform state in managing AWS resources:
   - Terraform state stores the current state of infrastructure and is crucial for tracking changes, enabling Terraform to plan and apply updates accurately.

### 9. Managing and sharing Terraform state in a team:
   - Terraform state can be stored remotely (e.g., in AWS S3) and locked to prevent concurrent modifications, facilitating collaboration and version control in a team.

### 10. Handling AWS resource dependencies and provisioning order in Terraform:
    - Terraform automatically manages dependencies based on resource definitions, ensuring correct provisioning order during execution.

### 11. Purpose of the `terraform init` command in AWS Terraform:
    - `terraform init` initializes a Terraform configuration, downloading required plugins and modules, preparing the environment for subsequent commands.

## 12. Managing multiple AWS environments using Terraform workspaces:
    - Terraform workspaces enable the creation of isolated environments within a single configuration, allowing for efficient management of development, staging, and production environments.

Terraform workspaces allow you to manage multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) within the same configuration. Each workspace can have its own set of Terraform state files, allowing you to isolate resources and configurations. Below is an example of managing multiple AWS environments using Terraform workspaces:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  bucket = "example-bucket-${terraform.workspace}"
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI, replace with your desired AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance-${terraform.workspace}"
  }
}
```

In this example, the S3 bucket and EC2 instance resources have names and tags that include the current workspace name. This helps to create distinct resources for each environment.

Now, let's create and switch between workspaces:

1. **Create Workspaces:**

   ```bash
   terraform workspace new dev
   terraform workspace new prod
   ```

   This creates two workspaces named "dev" and "prod." You can replace these with your desired environment names.

2. **Switch Between Workspaces:**

   ```bash
   terraform workspace select dev
   ```

   Or, alternatively:

   ```bash
   terraform workspace select prod
   ```

3. **Apply Changes:**

   After selecting the workspace, you can apply changes as usual:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Terraform will create resources with names and tags specific to the selected workspace.

By using workspaces, you can manage separate states for each environment and avoid conflicts between them. It's important to note that workspaces are not a security boundary, so they are more suitable for separating configurations and state than for isolating sensitive data.

Remember to follow best practices for managing infrastructure as code and consider additional security measures, such as using AWS IAM roles and policies for different environments.

### 13. Creating and managing an AWS VPC with Terraform:
    - A VPC in Terraform is defined using the `aws_vpc` resource, specifying details like CIDR block, subnets, and route tables.
Certainly! Creating and managing an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with Terraform involves defining the VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups, and other related components. Below is an example Terraform script that creates a simple VPC with two subnets (public and private) and associated resources:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Create VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "my_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_support = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true

  tags = {
    Name = "my-vpc"
  }
}

# Create public subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "public_subnet" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  cidr_block              = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone       = "us-east-1a"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true

  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet"
  }
}

# Create private subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "private_subnet" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  cidr_block              = "10.0.2.0/24"
  availability_zone       = "us-east-1b"

  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet"
  }
}

# Create internet gateway
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "my_igw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id

  tags = {
    Name = "my-igw"
  }
}

# Attach internet gateway to public subnet
resource "aws_route_table" "public_route" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id

  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.my_igw.id
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "public-route-table"
  }
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "public_subnet_association" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public_subnet.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public_route.id
}

# Create security group for EC2 instances in private subnet
resource "aws_security_group" "private_instance_sg" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = -1
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "private-instance-sg"
  }
}
```

This script defines a VPC with a public subnet, a private subnet, an internet gateway, and associated route tables and security groups. Please customize the CIDR blocks, availability zones, and other parameters according to your requirements.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the AWS VPC.

This is a basic example, and you can extend it based on your specific needs, such as adding more subnets, configuring Network Address Translation (NAT) gateways for private subnets, and defining additional security groups.

## 14. Provisioning and configuring AWS EC2 instances with Terraform:
    - AWS EC2 instances are defined in Terraform using the `aws_instance` resource, specifying instance type, AMI, and other configurations.

Certainly! Below is an example Terraform script that provisions and configures AWS EC2 instances:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS key pair for SSH access
resource "aws_key_pair" "my_key_pair" {
  key_name   = "my-key-pair"
  public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")  # Replace with the path to your public key file
}

# Define an AWS security group for EC2 instances
resource "aws_security_group" "my_security_group" {
  name        = "my-security-group"
  description = "Allow SSH and HTTP traffic"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Define an AWS EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  ami             = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI, replace with your desired AMI
  instance_type   = "t2.micro"
  key_name        = aws_key_pair.my_key_pair.key_name
  security_group  = [aws_security_group.my_security_group.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "my-instance"
  }

  # User data script for configuring the instance
  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              yum update -y
              yum install -y httpd
              systemctl start httpd
              systemctl enable httpd
              echo "Hello from my EC2 instance!" > /var/www/html/index.html
              EOF
}

# Output the public IP address of the instance
output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.my_instance.public_ip
}
```

This script creates an EC2 instance with a specific Amazon Machine Image (AMI), instance type, key pair, security group, and user data script for basic configuration. The user data script installs Apache HTTP server and outputs a simple HTML page.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the EC2 instance.

Note: Make sure to replace the placeholder values, such as the AMI ID and the path to your public key file, with your actual values.

This is a basic example, and you can customize it based on your specific requirements, such as specifying additional configuration, using different instance types, or integrating with other AWS services.

### 15. Difference between AWS Elastic IP and AWS Elastic Network Interface (ENI):
    - An Elastic IP is a static public IP, while an ENI is a virtual network interface that can have both private and public IPs.

### 16. Managing AWS security groups and their rules with Terraform:
    - Security groups are defined using the `aws_security_group` resource in Terraform, specifying inbound and outbound rules for network traffic.
Certainly! Managing AWS security groups and their rules with Terraform involves defining the security group, specifying ingress and egress rules, and associating the security group with resources like EC2 instances. Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating an AWS security group with specific rules:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS security group
resource "aws_security_group" "my_security_group" {
  name        = "my-security-group"
  description = "Allow SSH and HTTP traffic"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Define an AWS EC2 instance associated with the security group
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  ami             = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI, replace with your desired AMI
  instance_type   = "t2.micro"
  key_name        = "your-key-pair"  # Replace with your key pair
  security_group  = [aws_security_group.my_security_group.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "my-instance"
  }
}
```

In this script:

- A security group named "my-security-group" is defined with ingress rules allowing SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) traffic. The egress rule allows all outbound traffic.
- An EC2 instance (`aws_instance`) is defined and associated with the created security group.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the security group and EC2 instance.

Remember to replace placeholder values, such as the AMI ID, key pair, and any other specific configurations, with your actual values.

This is a basic example, and you can customize it based on your specific security requirements and the resources you want to associate with the security group. Always follow the principle of least privilege when defining security group rules.

### 17. Provisioning AWS IAM roles and policies with Terraform:
    - Terraform uses `aws_iam_role` and `aws_iam_policy` resources to define IAM roles and policies, enabling fine-grained access control.
    Provisioning AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles and policies with Terraform involves defining the IAM resources and their associated policies. Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating an IAM role with an attached policy:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS IAM policy document
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role" {
  source_json = <<-JSON
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }
  JSON
}

# Define an AWS IAM role
resource "aws_iam_role" "ec2_role" {
  name                 = "ec2-instance-role"
  assume_role_policy  = data.aws_iam_policy_document.assume_role.json
}

# Define an AWS IAM policy
resource "aws_iam_policy" "s3_read_policy" {
  name        = "s3-read-policy"
  description = "Allow read access to S3 buckets"
  
  policy = <<-JSON
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
          "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "s3:GetObject",
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }
  JSON
}

# Attach the IAM policy to the IAM role
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "s3_read_attachment" {
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.s3_read_policy.arn
  role       = aws_iam_role.ec2_role.name
}
```

In this script:

- An IAM policy document named "assume_role" is created, specifying that the role can be assumed by the EC2 service.
- An IAM role named "ec2-instance-role" is defined with the assume role policy from the IAM policy document.
- An IAM policy named "s3-read-policy" is defined, allowing read access to S3 buckets.
- The IAM policy is attached to the IAM role using `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the IAM role and policy.

Remember to replace placeholder values and customize the policies according to your specific requirements. Additionally, consider using variables to make the script more reusable and adaptable to different use cases.

This example is relatively basic, and IAM roles and policies can be more complex depending on your organization's security and access control requirements. Always follow best practices when designing IAM policies to ensure the principle of least privilege.

### 18. Configuring AWS Auto Scaling groups and launch configurations with Terraform:
    - Terraform defines Auto Scaling groups and launch configurations using `aws_autoscaling_group` and `aws_launch_configuration` resources, facilitating dynamic scaling.
Configuring AWS Auto Scaling groups and launch configurations with Terraform involves defining the Auto Scaling resources, launch configurations, and associated settings. Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating an Auto Scaling group and a launch configuration:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS launch configuration
resource "aws_launch_configuration" "my_launch_config" {
  name = "my-launch-config"
  
  # Specify the AMI for instances
  image_id = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Replace with your desired AMI
  
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  # User data script for configuring instances
  user_data = <<-EOF
                #!/bin/bash
                yum update -y
                yum install -y httpd
                systemctl start httpd
                systemctl enable httpd
                echo "Hello from my Auto Scaling instance!" > /var/www/html/index.html
              EOF
}

# Define an AWS Auto Scaling group
resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "my_asg" {
  desired_capacity     = 2
  max_size             = 3
  min_size             = 1
  vpc_zone_identifier = ["subnet-xxxxxxxx", "subnet-yyyyyyyy"]  # Replace with your subnet IDs
  
  launch_configuration = aws_launch_configuration.my_launch_config.id
}

# Output the Auto Scaling group name
output "autoscaling_group_name" {
  value = aws_autoscaling_group.my_asg.name
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS launch configuration named "my-launch-config" is defined with settings such as the AMI, instance type, and user data script for configuring instances.
- An AWS Auto Scaling group named "my_asg" is defined with desired capacity, minimum size, maximum size, and VPC settings. It is associated with the launch configuration.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the launch configuration and Auto Scaling group.

Remember to replace placeholder values, such as the AMI ID and subnet IDs, with your actual values. Additionally, customize the script based on your specific requirements, such as instance type, scaling policies, and other Auto Scaling configurations.

This example creates a basic Auto Scaling setup. Depending on your needs, you might want to add more advanced configurations, health checks, scaling policies, and other parameters to suit your application's requirements.

### 19. Provisioning AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) with Terraform:
    - ELBs are provisioned using the `aws_lb` resource in Terraform, specifying listeners, target groups, and other configurations.
Provisioning AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) with Terraform involves defining the load balancer, its listeners, and any associated settings. Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with listeners:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS security group for the ALB
resource "aws_security_group" "alb_sg" {
  name        = "alb-security-group"
  description = "Allow traffic to ALB"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Define an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
resource "aws_lb" "my_alb" {
  name               = "my-alb"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  security_groups    = [aws_security_group.alb_sg.id]
  enable_deletion_protection = false  # Set to true to enable deletion protection

  enable_cross_zone_load_balancing = true

  subnets = ["subnet-xxxxxxxx", "subnet-yyyyyyyy"]  # Replace with your subnet IDs
}

# Define an ALB listener
resource "aws_lb_listener" "my_alb_listener" {
  load_balancer_arn = aws_lb.my_alb.arn
  port              = 80
  protocol          = "HTTP"

  default_action {
    type             = "fixed-response"
    fixed_response {
      content_type = "text/plain"
      status_code  = "200"
      message_body = "OK"
    }
  }
}

# Output the DNS name of the ALB
output "alb_dns_name" {
  value = aws_lb.my_alb.dns_name
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS security group named "alb-security-group" is defined to allow traffic on port 80.
- An AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) named "my-alb" is defined with settings such as the load balancer type, security groups, and subnets.
- An ALB listener is defined on port 80, using a fixed response action for demonstration purposes.
- An output is defined to display the DNS name of the ALB.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the ALB.

Remember to replace placeholder values, such as the subnet IDs, with your actual values. Additionally, customize the script based on your specific requirements, such as listener rules, SSL/TLS settings, health checks, and other ALB configurations.

This example provides a basic setup for an ALB. Depending on your use case, you might need to incorporate additional features and settings provided by AWS ALBs.

### 20. Purpose of AWS Elastic Beanstalk and managing it with Terraform:
    - AWS Elastic Beanstalk simplifies application deployment and scaling, and Terraform can manage Beanstalk environments through the `aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment` resource.



### 21. Managing AWS Lambda functions and their configurations using Terraform:
  Managing AWS Lambda functions and their configurations using Terraform involves defining the Lambda function, specifying the runtime, handler, source code, and any necessary settings. Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating a basic AWS Lambda function:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS Lambda function
resource "aws_lambda_function" "my_lambda_function" {
  function_name = "my-lambda-function"
  runtime       = "python3.8"
  handler       = "index.handler"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda_execution_role.arn
  timeout       = 30  # Timeout in seconds
  memory_size   = 128  # Memory size in MB

  # The source code for the Lambda function
  # You can replace this with the path to your own deployment package or a S3 bucket location
  filename      = "lambda_function_payload.zip"

  # Environment variables for the Lambda function
  environment = {
    variables = {
      ENV_VAR_KEY = "value",
    }
  }

  # Specify IAM role permissions for the Lambda function
  # This is a basic example; adjust based on your needs
  depends_on = [aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.lambda_execution_attachment]
}

# Define an IAM role for the Lambda function
resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_execution_role" {
  name = "lambda_execution_role"

  assume_role_policy = <<-EOF
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  EOF
}

# Attach an IAM policy to the Lambda execution role
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "lambda_execution_attachment" {
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"
  role       = aws_iam_role.lambda_execution_role.name
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS Lambda function named "my-lambda-function" is defined with settings such as the runtime (Python 3.8), handler (entry point in the code), role (IAM execution role), timeout, memory size, source code location (filename), and environment variables.
- An IAM role (`aws_iam_role`) is defined for the Lambda function, allowing it to assume the necessary permissions.
- An IAM policy (`aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`) is attached to the IAM role to provide basic execution permissions for Lambda.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the Lambda function.

Replace the placeholder values, such as the runtime, handler, and source code location, with your actual values. Adjust the IAM role permissions according to your specific requirements.

This example creates a basic Lambda function. Depending on your use case, you might need to incorporate additional settings, event sources, and dependencies for a fully functional Lambda deployment.

### 22. Provisioning AWS RDS database instances using Terraform:
Provisioning AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) instances using Terraform involves defining the RDS instance, specifying the database engine, instance type, storage, and any other necessary settings. Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating an AWS RDS instance:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS RDS instance
resource "aws_db_instance" "my_rds_instance" {
  identifier           = "my-rds-instance"
  engine               = "mysql"  # Replace with your desired database engine (e.g., "postgres", "sqlserver", etc.)
  instance_class       = "db.t2.micro"
  allocated_storage    = 20  # Allocated storage in GB
  storage_type         = "gp2"  # General Purpose SSD storage
  engine_version       = "5.7"  # Replace with the desired engine version
  username             = "admin_user"
  password             = "admin_password"
  publicly_accessible  = false
  multi_az             = false
  skip_final_snapshot  = true  # Set to false if you want a final snapshot when the RDS instance is deleted

  # Specify the subnet group and security group for the RDS instance
  db_subnet_group_name = aws_db_subnet_group.my_db_subnet_group.name
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.my_db_security_group.id]

  # Additional settings (customize as needed)
  parameter_group_name  = "default.mysql5.7"
  backup_retention_period = 7
  maintenance_window     = "Sun:00:00-Sun:01:00"
}

# Define an RDS subnet group
resource "aws_db_subnet_group" "my_db_subnet_group" {
  name       = "my-db-subnet-group"
  subnet_ids = ["subnet-xxxxxxxx", "subnet-yyyyyyyy"]  # Replace with your subnet IDs
}

# Define an AWS security group for the RDS instance
resource "aws_security_group" "my_db_security_group" {
  name        = "my-db-security-group"
  description = "Allow traffic to RDS instance"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 3306
    to_port     = 3306
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS RDS instance named "my-rds-instance" is defined with settings such as the database engine (MySQL in this case), instance class, allocated storage, storage type, and authentication details.
- A subnet group (`aws_db_subnet_group`) is defined to specify the subnets in which the RDS instance will be deployed.
- A security group (`aws_security_group`) is defined to allow traffic to the RDS instance on the specified port (3306 for MySQL).

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the RDS instance.

Replace placeholder values, such as the engine, subnet IDs, and security group settings, with your actual values. Customize additional settings based on your specific requirements.

This example provides a basic setup for an RDS instance. Depending on your use case, you might need to incorporate additional features, such as encryption, parameter groups, and other advanced configurations.

### 23. Purpose of AWS CloudFront, and managing it using Terraform:
  **Purpose of AWS CloudFront:**
AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally. It integrates with other Amazon Web Services products to give developers and businesses an easy way to distribute content to end-users with low latency, high data transfer speeds, and increased availability.

Key features of AWS CloudFront include:

1. **Content Delivery:** Distribute content (such as images, videos, and static files) from edge locations around the world, reducing latency for end-users.

2. **Global Reach:** CloudFront has a global network of edge locations, allowing it to serve content to users from the nearest available location.

3. **Security:** Support for HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, integration with AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) for protection against common web exploits, and the ability to restrict access using signed URLs or cookies.

4. **Scalability:** Automatically scales with demand, ensuring high availability and low latency.

Now, let's see an example of managing AWS CloudFront using Terraform:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS S3 bucket for storing content
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_s3_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-s3-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}

# Define an AWS CloudFront distribution
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "my_cloudfront_distribution" {
  origin {
    domain_name = aws_s3_bucket.my_s3_bucket.bucket_regional_domain_name
    origin_id   = aws_s3_bucket.my_s3_bucket.id
  }

  enabled             = true
  is_ipv6_enabled     = true
  comment             = "My CloudFront Distribution"
  default_root_object = "index.html"

  # Specify additional settings as needed

  # Viewer protocol policy - redirect HTTP to HTTPS
  default_cache_behavior {
    allowed_methods  = ["GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"]
    cached_methods   = ["GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"]
    target_origin_id = aws_s3_bucket.my_s3_bucket.id

    forwarded_values {
      query_string = false
      cookies {
        forward = "none"
      }
    }

    viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
    min_ttl                = 0
    default_ttl            = 3600
    max_ttl                = 86400
  }

  # Additional cache behaviors or settings can be added here

  # SSL/TLS settings
  viewer_certificate {
    acm_certificate_arn = "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd5678"
    ssl_support_method = "sni-only"
  }
}

# Output the CloudFront distribution domain name
output "cloudfront_domain_name" {
  value = aws_cloudfront_distribution.my_cloudfront_distribution.domain_name
}
```

In this example:

- An S3 bucket is created to store the content that CloudFront will distribute.
- A CloudFront distribution is defined, specifying the S3 bucket as the origin, enabling IPv6, and configuring various settings such as the default root object, cache behaviors, and SSL/TLS settings.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the CloudFront distribution.

Replace placeholder values, such as the S3 bucket name, ACM certificate ARN, and other settings, with your actual values. Customize additional settings based on your specific requirements.

### 24. Provisioning and configuring AWS S3 buckets and objects using Terraform:
Provisioning and configuring AWS S3 buckets and objects using Terraform involves defining the S3 resources, specifying bucket properties, and managing the objects within the bucket. Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating an S3 bucket and uploading objects to it:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_s3_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"  # Replace with a globally unique bucket name
  acl    = "private"

  # Enable versioning for the bucket
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }

  # Enable server-side encryption with an AWS managed key (SSE-S3)
  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        sse_algorithm = "AES256"
      }
    }
  }

  # Enable logging to a different S3 bucket
  logging {
    target_bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_log_bucket.bucket
    target_prefix = "logs/"
  }

  # Configure lifecycle rules for object expiration
  lifecycle_rule {
    enabled = true

    # Expire objects in the "logs/" prefix after 30 days
    expiration {
      days = 30
    }

    # Transition objects in the "archive/" prefix to the GLACIER storage class after 60 days
    transition {
      days          = 60
      storage_class = "GLACIER"
    }
  }
}

# Define another S3 bucket for logging
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_log_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-log-bucket-name"  # Replace with a globally unique bucket name
  acl    = "private"
}

# Upload a sample object to the S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "sample_object" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_s3_bucket.bucket
  key    = "example.txt"
  source = "path/to/local/file/example.txt"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

In this script:

- An S3 bucket (`aws_s3_bucket`) is defined with various settings, including ACL (Access Control List), versioning, server-side encryption, logging, and lifecycle rules.
- Another S3 bucket is created for logging purposes (`aws_s3_bucket`).
- A sample object (`aws_s3_bucket_object`) is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the S3 buckets and upload the sample object.

Replace placeholder values, such as the bucket names and local file path, with your actual values. Customize additional settings based on your specific requirements, such as permissions, versioning, and logging configurations.

This example provides a basic setup for managing S3 buckets and objects. Depending on your use case, you might need to incorporate additional features, such as bucket policies, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configurations, or event notifications.

### 25. Provisioning AWS CloudWatch resources and alarms using Terraform:
 Provisioning AWS CloudWatch resources and alarms using Terraform involves defining the CloudWatch resources, specifying metrics, and creating alarms based on those metrics. Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating a CloudWatch metric and an associated alarm:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS CloudWatch metric filter and log group
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter" "my_metric_filter" {
  name           = "my-metric-filter"
  pattern        = "[ERROR]"
  log_group_name = "/aws/lambda/my-lambda-function"  # Replace with your actual log group name
}

# Define a CloudWatch metric based on the metric filter
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "my_metric_alarm" {
  alarm_name          = "my-metric-alarm"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 1
  threshold           = 1
  period              = 60  # Evaluation period in seconds
  statistic           = "Sum"
  metric_name         = "Errors"
  namespace           = "LogMetrics"
  alarm_description   = "Alarm when the number of errors is greater than or equal to 1"
  actions_enabled     = true

  dimensions = {
    log_group_name = aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter.my_metric_filter.log_group_name
  }

  alarm_actions = ["arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sns-topic"]  # Replace with your actual SNS topic ARN
}

# Define an SNS topic for alarm notifications
resource "aws_sns_topic" "my_sns_topic" {
  name = "my-sns-topic"
}

# Subscribe an email address to the SNS topic for notifications
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "my_sns_subscription" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.my_sns_topic.arn
  protocol  = "email"
  endpoint  = "your.email@example.com"  # Replace with your actual email address
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS CloudWatch log metric filter (`aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter`) is defined to filter logs for a specific pattern ("[ERROR]") within a log group associated with a Lambda function.
- An AWS CloudWatch metric alarm (`aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm`) is defined based on the metric filter. This alarm triggers when the number of errors is greater than or equal to 1 within a 60-second evaluation period.
- An AWS SNS topic (`aws_sns_topic`) is defined for alarm notifications.
- An AWS SNS topic subscription (`aws_sns_topic_subscription`) is created to subscribe an email address to receive notifications.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the CloudWatch metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription.

Replace placeholder values, such as the log group name and SNS topic ARN, with your actual values. Customize additional settings based on your specific requirements, such as different comparison operators, thresholds, or actions for the alarm.

This example provides a basic setup for creating a CloudWatch metric and alarm for log events. Depending on your use case, you might need to adjust the script to match your specific metrics and alarm criteria.

### 26. Purpose of AWS Route 53, and managing it using Terraform:
**Purpose of AWS Route 53:**
AWS Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service provided by Amazon Web Services. It serves two main purposes:

1. **Domain Registration:** Route 53 allows users to register and manage domain names, making it easy to find and connect resources on the internet. It provides tools to search for available domain names and register them.

2. **DNS Service:** Route 53 is a scalable DNS web service that translates user-friendly domain names like www.example.com into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the internet. It also provides other DNS-related features, such as health checks, routing policies, and domain name forwarding.

**Managing AWS Route 53 using Terraform:**

Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating a hosted zone in Route 53 and adding a simple record set:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS Route 53 hosted zone
resource "aws_route53_zone" "my_route53_zone" {
  name = "example.com"
}

# Define an AWS Route 53 record set (A record)
resource "aws_route53_record" "my_record_set" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.my_route53_zone.zone_id
  name    = "www"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = "300"  # Time to live in seconds
  records = ["1.2.3.4"]  # Replace with the actual IP address
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS Route 53 hosted zone (`aws_route53_zone`) is defined for the domain "example.com."
- An AWS Route 53 record set (`aws_route53_record`) is defined as an A record for the subdomain "www" pointing to the IP address "1.2.3.4."

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the Route 53 hosted zone and record set.

Replace placeholder values, such as the domain name and IP address, with your actual values. Customize additional settings based on your specific requirements, such as different record types, routing policies, or additional records.

This example provides a basic setup for managing Route 53 using Terraform. Depending on your use case, you might need to adjust the script to match your specific DNS configuration and domain requirements.

  family                   = "my-task-family"
  network_mode             = "bridge"
  requires_compatibilities = ["FARGATE"]
  cpu                      = "256"  # CPU units for the task (example value)
  memory                   = "512"  # Memory in MiB for the task (example value)

  container_definitions = jsonencode([{
    name  = "my-container"
    image = "nginx:latest"  # Replace with your container image

    # Additional container settings can be specified here
  }])
}

# Define an AWS ECS service
resource "aws_ecs_service" "my_ecs_service" {
  name            = "my-ecs-service"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.my_ecs_cluster.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.my_task_definition.arn
  launch_type     = "FARGATE"

  network_configuration {
    subnets = ["subnet-xxxxxxxx", "subnet-yyyyyyyy"]  # Replace with your subnet IDs
    security_groups = ["sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"]  # Replace with your security group ID
  }

  desired_count = 2  # Number of tasks to run in the service
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS ECS cluster (`aws_ecs_cluster`) is defined with a specified name.
- An AWS ECS task definition (`aws_ecs_task_definition`) is defined with container definitions, specifying the container name, image, and additional settings.
- An AWS ECS service (`aws_ecs_service`) is defined with the desired configuration, including the cluster, task definition, launch type (FARGATE in this case), network configuration, and the desired number of tasks to run in the service.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.

# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS ElastiCache cluster (Redis)
resource "aws_elasticache_cluster" "my_redis_cluster" {
  cluster_id           = "my-redis-cluster"
  engine               = "redis"
  node_type            = "cache.t2.micro"  # Replace with your desired instance type
  num_cache_nodes      = 1
  port                 = 6379
  parameter_group_name = "default.redis5.0.cluster.on"

  # Optionally, specify subnet group and security group
  subnet_group_name = "my-subnet-group"  # Replace with your subnet group name
  security_group_ids = ["sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"]  # Replace with your security group ID

  # Optionally, specify encryption settings
  at_rest_encryption_enabled = true
  transit_encryption_enabled = true
}

# Output the ElastiCache cluster endpoint
output "elasticache_endpoint" {
  value = aws_elasticache_cluster.my_redis_cluster.cache_nodes[0].address
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS ElastiCache cluster (`aws_elasticache_cluster`) is defined with settings such as the cluster ID, cache engine (Redis), instance type, number of cache nodes, port, parameter group, and optional configurations like subnet group, security group, and encryption settings.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the ElastiCache cluster.

Replace placeholder values, such as the region, instance type, subnet group name, security group ID, and other settings, with your actual values. Customize additional settings based on your specific requirements, such as enabling Multi-AZ deployment, adjusting maintenance windows, or adding tags.

This example provides a basic setup for managing AWS ElastiCache clusters with Redis using Terraform. If you want to use Memcached, you can change the `engine` parameter to "memcached" and adjust the configuration accordingly. Depending on your use case, you may need to incorporate additional configurations or features.

### 29. Managing AWS Elastic File System (EFS) using Terraform:
Managing AWS Elastic File System (EFS) using Terraform involves defining the EFS resources, specifying the file system properties, and configuring the desired settings. Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating an AWS EFS file system:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS Elastic File System (EFS) file system
resource "aws_efs_file_system" "my_efs" {
  creation_token = "my-efs"  # A unique name for the EFS file system

  # Optionally, specify lifecycle_policy and performance_mode
  lifecycle_policy = "AFTER_7_DAYS"
  performance_mode = "generalPurpose"

  # Optionally, specify tags for the EFS file system
  tags = {
    Name = "MyEFS"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

# Define an AWS EFS mount target in each availability zone
resource "aws_efs_mount_target" "my_efs_mount_target" {
  count      = 2
  file_system_id = aws_efs_file_system.my_efs.id
  subnet_id  = element(["subnet-xxxxxxxx", "subnet-yyyyyyyy"], count.index)
  security_groups = ["sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"]  # Replace with your security group ID
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS Elastic File System (EFS) file system (`aws_efs_file_system`) is defined with settings such as the creation token, lifecycle policy, performance mode, and optional tags.
- An AWS EFS mount target (`aws_efs_mount_target`) is defined for each availability zone, associating it with the EFS file system and specifying the subnet and security group.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the EFS file system and mount targets.

Customize additional settings based on your specific requirements, such as enabling encryption, adjusting throughput modes, or specifying performance settings.

This example provides a basic setup for managing AWS EFS using Terraform. Depending on your use case, you might want to incorporate additional features or settings, such as setting up access points, configuring automatic backups, or adjusting network configurations.

### 30. Purpose of AWS Secrets Manager, and integrating it with Terraform:
**Purpose of AWS Secrets Manager:**

AWS Secrets Manager is a fully managed service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to securely store and manage sensitive information such as API keys, database passwords, and other credentials. It helps you protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources without the need to hardcode sensitive information directly in your code or configuration files.

Key features of AWS Secrets Manager include:

1. **Secret Storage:** Securely store and manage sensitive information such as database passwords, API keys, and other credentials.

2. **Rotation:** Automate the process of rotating credentials to enhance security. AWS Secrets Manager can automatically rotate credentials based on defined policies.

3. **Access Control:** Manage access to secrets using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, allowing you to control who can retrieve or modify secret values.

4. **Integration with RDS:** Easily integrate with Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for automatic credential rotation and management.

5. **Audit and Monitoring:** Monitor and audit the usage of secrets, with the ability to log events to AWS CloudWatch.

**Integrating AWS Secrets Manager with Terraform:**

To use AWS Secrets Manager with Terraform, you can leverage the `aws_secretsmanager_secret` resource to define a secret, and `aws_secretsmanager_secret_version` to specify the secret value. Below is a basic example:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS Secrets Manager secret
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "my_secret" {
  name = "my-secret"
  description = "My secret description"
}

# Define the version of the secret (specify the actual secret value)
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "my_secret_version" {
  secret_id     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.my_secret.id
  secret_string = "my-secret-value"
}

# Output the ARN of the secret
output "secret_arn" {
  value = aws_secretsmanager_secret.my_secret.arn
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS Secrets Manager secret (`aws_secretsmanager_secret`) is defined with a name and description.
- A version of the secret (`aws_secretsmanager_secret_version`) is specified with the actual secret value.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the AWS Secrets Manager secret.

Replace placeholder values, such as the region, secret name, and secret value, with your actual values. Customize additional settings based on your specific requirements, such as rotation configuration or access policies.

This example provides a basic setup for integrating AWS Secrets Manager with Terraform. Depending on your use case, you might want to explore additional features, such as rotation policies, automatic rotation, or integration with other AWS services.

### 31. Provisioning AWS API Gateway and its resources using Terraform:

}

# Define a resource for the API
resource "aws_api_gateway_resource" "my_resource" {
  rest_api_id = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.my_api.id
  parent_id   = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.my_api.root_resource_id
  path_part   = "myresource"
}

# Define an HTTP method (GET) for the resource
resource "aws_api_gateway_method" "my_method" {
  rest_api_id   = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.my_api.id
  resource_id   = aws_api_gateway_resource.my_resource.id
  http_method   = "GET"
  authorization = "NONE"
}

}

# Define an AWS DynamoDB table
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "my_dynamodb_table" {
  name           = "MyTable"
  billing_mode   = "PROVISIONED"  # Change to "PAY_PER_REQUEST" for on-demand capacity
  read_capacity  = 5
  write_capacity = 5

  attribute {
    name = "MyPartitionKey"
    type = "S"  # String data type
  }

  attribute {
    name = "MySortKey"
    type = "N"  # Number data type
  }

  key_schema {
    attribute_name = "MyPartitionKey"
    key_type       = "HASH"  # Partition key
  }

  key_schema {
    attribute_name = "MySortKey"
    key_type       = "RANGE"  # Sort key
  }

  global_secondary_index {
    name               = "MyGSI"
    hash_key           = "MySortKey"
    range_key          = "MyPartitionKey"
    read_capacity      = 5
    write_capacity     = 5
    projection_type    = "ALL"
  }
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS DynamoDB table (`aws_dynamodb_table`) is defined with a name, billing mode (provisioned or on-demand), read and write capacity, attributes, key schema (partition key and sort key), and an optional global secondary index (GSI).

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the DynamoDB table.

Replace placeholder values, such as the region, table name, attribute names, key types, and other settings, with your actual values. Customize additional settings based on your specific requirements, such as adding local secondary indexes, adjusting capacity settings, or specifying provisioned throughput.

This example provides a basic setup for managing AWS DynamoDB tables using Terraform. Depending on your use case, you might want to explore additional features, such as specifying TTL (Time to Live) settings, configuring stream settings, or setting up point-in-time recovery.
### 33. Purpose of AWS CloudTrail, and configuring it with Terraform:
**Purpose of AWS CloudTrail:**

AWS CloudTrail is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. It records and stores AWS API call activities, providing a comprehensive and chronological view of actions taken by users, roles, or services within your AWS environment. Key features and purposes of AWS CloudTrail include:

1. **Auditing AWS Resource Changes:** CloudTrail helps you track changes to AWS resources, providing visibility into who made the changes, when they were made, and the details of the changes.

2. **Security Analysis and Monitoring:** It supports security analysis, resource change tracking, and incident detection by logging API activity.

3. **Compliance and Governance:** CloudTrail logs can be used to demonstrate compliance with internal policies or external regulations by showing a detailed record of actions taken on AWS resources.

4. **Troubleshooting and Operational Insights:** CloudTrail logs can be valuable for troubleshooting operational issues and gaining insights into the behavior of AWS resources.

**Configuring AWS CloudTrail with Terraform:**

To configure AWS CloudTrail using Terraform, you can use the `aws_cloudtrail` resource. Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating a CloudTrail trail:

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS CloudTrail trail
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "my_cloudtrail" {
  name                          = "my-cloudtrail"
  s3_bucket_name                = "my-cloudtrail-bucket"  # Replace with your S3 bucket name
  include_global_service_events = true
  is_multi_region_trail         = true
  enable_logging                = true

  # Optionally, specify SNS topic for CloudTrail notifications
  sns_topic_name = "my-cloudtrail-topic"  # Replace with your SNS topic name

  # Optionally, specify CloudWatch Logs for CloudTrail logs
  cloudwatch_logs_group_arn = "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:my-cloudtrail-logs:*"
  cloudwatch_logs_role_arn  = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-cloudtrail-role"
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS CloudTrail trail (`aws_cloudtrail`) is defined with settings such as the trail name, S3 bucket name for storing logs, inclusion of global service events, multi-region trail, and logging status.

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the CloudTrail trail.

Replace placeholder values, such as the region, trail name, S3 bucket name, SNS topic name, CloudWatch Logs group ARN, and role ARN, with your actual values. Customize additional settings based on your specific requirements, such as specifying tags or adjusting advanced settings.

This example provides a basic setup for configuring AWS CloudTrail with Terraform. Depending on your use case, you might want to explore additional features, such as setting up data events, configuring advanced event selectors, or integrating with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for log file encryption.

### 34. Managing AWS SNS topics and subscriptions using Terraform:
Managing AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics and subscriptions using Terraform involves defining the SNS resources, creating topics, and setting up subscriptions. Below is an example Terraform script that demonstrates creating an AWS SNS topic and a subscription:

  region = "us-east-1"  # Specify the AWS region
}

# Define an AWS SNS topic
resource "aws_sns_topic" "my_sns_topic" {
  name = "my-sns-topic"
  display_name = "My SNS Topic"
}

# Define an AWS SNS subscription (e.g., email subscription)
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "my_sns_subscription" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.my_sns_topic.arn
  protocol  = "email"
  endpoint  = "your.email@example.com"  # Replace with your actual email address
}
```

In this script:

- An AWS SNS topic (`aws_sns_topic`) is defined with a name and an optional display name.
- An AWS SNS subscription (`aws_sns_topic_subscription`) is defined for the topic, specifying the protocol (e.g., email) and the endpoint (e.g., email address).

To apply the configuration:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the SNS topic and subscription.

Replace placeholder values, such as the region, topic name, display name, and email address, with your actual values. Customize additional settings based on your specific requirements, such as adding multiple subscriptions, specifying delivery policies, or configuring access policies.

This example provides a basic setup for managing AWS SNS topics and subscriptions using Terraform. Depending on your use case, you might need to incorporate additional features, such as setting up different protocols for subscriptions (e.g., HTTP, SMS), configuring filter policies, or defining access control policies.
